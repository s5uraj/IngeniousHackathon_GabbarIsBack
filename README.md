Today in there are lots of people who are not getting proper medical facilities.

Currently medical representative visiting the village area / remote areaÂ  and are collecting the data manually.

We are making a ready to go kit which will be used to take the body vitals of the individuals and upload the data to the cloud.

Apart from just taking the body vitals 

- The data stored in the cloud will be used for 

  - the emergency dispatch and response

  - generate Public Health alerts and notifications services

  - create Public Health mapping.

To backend our data we are using the IBM watson cloud with blockchain technology which gives us more security, more privacy integrity and tamper-proofing of data.
